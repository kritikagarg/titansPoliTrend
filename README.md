# Tracking Political Trends Around US Presidential Election

## Overview
This project focuses on performing topic modeling on recent Twitter data related to the 2024 US election. By leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) and advanced techniques, we aim to identify and analyze trending topics while contextualizing them within public sentiment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `transformers`
  - `keybert`
  - `bertopic`
  - `llama_cpp`
<!---
## Setup
1. **Download Pretrained LLMs**: 
   - Download the following files from Hugging Face:
     - `OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF`
     - `dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b-GGUF`
   
   These files contain the pretrained models necessary for topic modeling.

2. **Load the Quantized LLM**: 
   - Use the `llama_cpp` library to load the quantized LLMs, which reduces the computational requirements and facilitates efficient processing.

3. **Models Used**:
   - **KeyBERT**: Fast keyword extraction model for identifying relevant keywords from the data.
   - **LlamaCPP**: Utilizes the quantized LLM to generate contextually relevant responses based on the input data.
